Problems/Hurdles:
- Carousel generation is time consuming, need to alot for propper time to complete this feature, used modal instead

Next Steps: 
- The project cards and modal can be improved visually
- More projects can be added to the projects section
- The resume should link to another new tab, not replace current
- Carousel can be used to traverse various projects
